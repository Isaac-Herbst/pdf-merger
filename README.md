# pdf-merger

I needed a program that would merge all `.pdf` files in a directory. It is a very amateur script I don't intend to upgrade.

## Explanation
The path that `directory` needs is the absolute path (e.g., `C:\path\to\your\directory`) of the desired directory. If any file in the directory ends with `.pdf`, then it will be read in. The script reads in files in alphabetical order. The output of this program is a single PDF that is the result of combining all other PDFs in that directory.

## Usage
The script is a `.py` file, so run it with [Python](https://www.python.org/).
