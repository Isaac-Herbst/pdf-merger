# pdf-merger
 
I needed a program that would merge all `.pdf` files in a directory. It is a very amateur script I dont intend to upgrade.

## Explanation
The path that `directory` needs is the absolute path ("C:\...\...") of the desired directory. If any file in directory ends in `.pdf`, then it will be read in. The script reads in files in alphabetical order. The output of this program is a singular pdf that is the result of combining all other pdf's in that directory.

## Usage
The scrpit is `.py`, so run with [python.org] (Python).
